After setting up the python enviornment in the 
<a href="http://benedict-chan.github.io/blog/2014/11/07/setup-python-environment-in-visual-studio/">previous post</a>. I am going to run some python scripts to test our enviornment.


### The exercise ###
The example is actually some exercises provided by the following link:
<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/nborwankar/LearnDataScience/master/notebooks/A2.%20Linear%20Regression%20-%20Data%20Exploration%20-%20Lending%20Club.ipynb" target="_blank">A2. Linear Regression - Data Exploration - Lending Club</a>, which is part of the page <a href="https://github.com/nborwankar/LearnDataScience" target="_blank">Learn Data Science</a>.

The exercise includes:
- Reading a sample csv data into `pandas`
- Removing % signs from rates
- Removing the word "months" from loan length.
- Managing outliers, remove such rows in this case

I have implemented them as an `ipython notebook` and it can be previewed <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/benedict-chan/pytest/blob/master/LearnDataScience/a2-linear-regression.ipynb" target="_blank" >here</a>.
